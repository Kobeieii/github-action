# Automate Deployment using GitHub Actions and Google Cloud Run

This repository demonstrates how to automate the deployment of a web application built with **Vite**, **Vue 3**, and **TypeScript** using **GitHub Actions** and **Google Cloud Run**. It includes setup for managing separate **prod** and **dev** environments using **Google Cloud Run**, **Artifact Registry**, and **Workload Identity Federation** for keyless authentication.

## Features

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Ensures that every push to any branch triggers code checking (linting) and builds the project.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automatically deploys the application to Google Cloud Run in **prod** or **dev** environments based on the branch (`main` for production, `develop` for development).
- **Workload Identity Federation**: Secure, keyless authentication from GitHub Actions to Google Cloud, eliminating the need to manage service account keys.
- **Containerization**: The project is built as a Docker container and pushed to **Google Artifact Registry**.
- **Separate Environments**: Deployments are handled in distinct **prod** and **dev** environments for **Cloud Run** and **Artifact Registry**.
- **Cloud Run**: The container is deployed to a **Cloud Run** service in the specified Google Cloud region.

## Workflow Overview

### GitHub Actions Workflow: `Build and Deploy to Cloud Run`

The GitHub Actions workflow consists of two jobs:

1. **Code-Check**:

   - Runs linting and ensures that the project builds successfully with the specified Node.js version.

2. **Build-and-Deploy**:
   - Builds the Docker container for the web app.
   - Pushes the container to **Google Artifact Registry**.
   - Deploys the container to **Google Cloud Run**, choosing between the `dev` or `prod` environment based on the branch (`main` for production, `develop` for development).

### Workload Identity Federation

This project uses **Workload Identity Federation** to authenticate GitHub Actions with Google Cloud in a secure, keyless manner. This removes the need to store service account keys in GitHub secrets, improving security.

To learn more about setting up **Workload Identity Federation**, refer to [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/enabling-keyless-authentication-from-github-actions).

### Trigger

- The workflow is triggered on every push to any branch, but deployment only occurs on pushes to the `main` or `develop` branches.

### Workflow Syntax

To learn more about GitHub Actions workflow syntax, visit the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).

## Environments

- **Production**: When code is pushed to the `main` branch, the container is pushed to the **prod** repository in **Google Artifact Registry** and deployed to the **prod** Cloud Run service.
- **Development**: When code is pushed to the `develop` branch, the container is pushed to the **dev** repository in **Google Artifact Registry** and deployed to the **dev** Cloud Run service.

## Environment Variables

The following secrets and environment variables must be set in GitHub Secrets for the workflow to function:

- `PROJECT_ID`: Your Google Cloud Project ID.
- `REGION`: The Google Cloud region where the service will be deployed (e.g., `asia-southeast1`).
- `WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER`: Workload identity provider to authenticate to Google Cloud.
- `SERVICE_ACCOUNT`: The service account to be used for deployments.
- **Separate Artifact Repositories**:
  - Use different repositories for dev and prod, e.g., `cloud-run-source-deploy-dev` and `cloud-run-source-deploy`.
